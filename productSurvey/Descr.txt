Summary

    Feedback form elements: The HTML structure includes input fields for name, age, email,
     job, designation, a dropdown for product type selection, and a textarea for feedback
      submission. This comprehensive design ensures the collection of user-provided
       information.

    Dynamic user information display: JavaScript function "submitFeedback()" 
    processes user input upon button click or Enter key press, displaying entered
     details dynamically below the form, including name, age, email, job, designation,
      selected product type, and the provided feedback.

    Visibility toggle: Initially hidden, a section below the form remains concealed
     until feedback submission. Upon submission, JavaScript alters its display to
      "block," showcasing the user's information and feedback for the selected product
       type.

    Event listeners implementation: Event listeners are employed to trigger the
     feedback submission function, enabling user interaction via both the
      "Submit Feedback" button click and the Enter key press for a seamless experience.
